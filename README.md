# passphrase-web

Simple password generator with web interface.

From time to time I need to generate password, but almost any web generator out there is over complicated or gives password maybe hard to crack but also hard to remember.

I wanted small, fast password generator and, what is most important - generated passwords must be easy to remember, but hard to crack. This little project tries to fulfill these requirements.

There is also version for those fallen in love with [CLI](https://github.com/sgrzywna/passphrase).
